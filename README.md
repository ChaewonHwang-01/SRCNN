# SRCNN
A Study on the SRCNN Paper (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network)

## ðŸ“„ Paper
**Link**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
This repository reproduces the SRCNN model and validates its results on:
- **Y-channel only (luminance)**
- **RGB channels**
Compare results with the original paper to verify consistency of PSNR/Bicubic values.

---

## ðŸ§ª Key Features
- Fully reimplemented SRCNN in **PyTorch** following paper architecture  
- Training conducted separately for:
  - âœ… **Y-channel only** (grayscale luminance)
  - âœ… **Full RGB**  
- Patch-based training from **T91 dataset**  
- Evaluation on **Set5** with average PSNR comparison  
- Visualization of super-resolved images (Y and RGB)  
- Bicubic baseline vs. SRCNN model comparison for both input types

## ðŸ“Š Results (Set5 Average PSNR)

| Scale | Method        | Bicubic (Paper, Y) | SRCNN (Paper, Y) | Bicubic (Mine, Y) | SRCNN (Mine, Y) |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Ã—2    | PSNR (dB)     | 33.66              | 36.66            | 32.79             | 34.61           | 
| Ã—3    | PSNR (dB)     | 30.39              | 32.75            | 29.32             | 30.89           | 
| Ã—4    | PSNR (dB)     | 28.42              | 30.49            | 27.31             | 28.95           |

## ðŸ“Š Results ("Butterfly" image from Set5 PSNR)

| Scale | Method        | Bicubic (Paper, RGB) | SRCNN (Paper, RGB) | Bicubic (Mine, Y) | SRCNN (Mine, Y) |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Ã—3    | PSNR (dB)     | 24.04                | 27.95              | 23.01             | 25.75           |

ðŸ“Ž *Note: SRCNN was originally designed for the Y (luminance) channel. 
RGB evaluation was performed only at scale Ã—3 in this project to examine full-color reconstruction performance.*
